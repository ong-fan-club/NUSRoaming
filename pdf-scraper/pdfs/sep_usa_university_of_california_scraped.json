For specific housing options at each UC campus and application instructions, please refer here: https://reciprocity.uceap.universityofcalifornia.edu/before-you-arrive/campus-specific-instructions. It may be difficult for students who would prefer non-UC housing in the community to finalise independent living (off-campus) arrangements before arrival. You should arrive at your host campus as early as possible (no more than 30 days prior to the programme start date on your visa document) to look for housing.",
