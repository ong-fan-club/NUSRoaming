For latest information on border control please see: [https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control](https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control). Standard Visitor Visa for Semester Exchange: If you are a Singapore citizen or a citizen of another country on the UK non-visa nationals list, and if your course of studies is less than 6 months, you will request entry to the UK as a Standard Visitor when you arrive. Singapore citizens do not normally need to meet with a Border Force agent, and will be able to enter the UK through E-gates. The E-gates will automatically grant you permission to stay in the UK for up to 6 months. You will not receive a stamp on your passport thus it is important that you retain evidence of when you entered the UK. Hence, please keep your boarding pass or evidence of your flight itinerary. Please refer here for more details on the Standard Visitor Visa. Student Visa for Full-Year Exchange: You need a Student Visa for a full-year exchange in Liverpool. For more details on visa application, read the information available here.",
