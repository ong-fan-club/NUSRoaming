  "visa_info": "All students are advised to apply for the necessary visa immediately after they receive the official offer letter/email from their host university. Some visa application processes can take up to 2 months to process. Your exchange at the host university depends on the clearance by the immigration of the host country. Once you are admitted to the university, Undergraduate Admissions will send you a Certificate of Eligibility (Form DS-2019). This document, together with your notification of admission, the financial guarantee and your passport, is used to obtain a J-1 visa at a U.S. consulate nearest to you. To apply for a visa in your home country, you must apply early and expect delays. Consult individual embassy Web sites for periodic updates on country-specific visa processing.",
  "accommodations_info": "While international students can live where they would like, they are encouraged to live on campus in ASU residence halls. On-campus living provides more opportunities to make lasting friendships. On-campus housing is NOT guaranteed for exchange students, and is assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. Students should apply for on-campus housing immediately after they receive their official university acceptance for the best chance of receiving an on-campus assignment; however, being placed in university housing is never guaranteed. Students who are not successful in securing on-campus housing, or who do not want to live in the student dormitories, can search for off-campus housing in homestays or apartments. Most apartments require a contract between seven to twelve months, and are not furnished.",
  "cost_of_living": "International exchange students do not pay ASU tuition, but must pay student initiated fees that are mandatory for ASU students (approximately USD $350 per semester). Students should also budget for additional costs such as mandatory health insurance, special course fees, books and supplies, housing, meals, local transportation, and personal expenses."
