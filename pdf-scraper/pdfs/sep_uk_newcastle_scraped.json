  "visa_info": "UK Visa and Immigration updates their immigration policy regularly. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to check on the requirements via their website before they leave for the exchange. Standard Visitor Visa for Semester Exchange: If you are a Singapore citizen or a citizen of another country on the UK non-visa nationals list, and if your course of studies is less than 6 months, you will request entry to the UK as a Standard Visitor when you arrive. Student Visa for Full-Year Exchange: You need a Student Visa for a full-year exchange in Newcastle. All students are advised to apply for the necessary visa immediately after they received the official offer letter/email from their host university. Some visa application processes can take up to 2 months to process. Your exchange at the host university depends on the clearance by the immigration of the host country.",

More information about university accommodation can be found at [here](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/support-and-services/#accommodation). Private Accommodation: If Newcastle is unable to allocate a place in University accommodation, they will provide information and guidance on how to look for accommodation in the private sector.",
