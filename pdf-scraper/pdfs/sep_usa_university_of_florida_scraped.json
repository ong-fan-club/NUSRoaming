  "visa_info": "Once a student is admitted to a non-degree program, the departmental contact in the UF host department must submit a J-1 Non-Degree Student Request through the UFIC ISSS online portal. After the request is submitted, the student will receive an email with instructions for completing their portion of the application. The student must complete all required forms and questionnaires, provide a copy of their valid passport and proof of sufficient funding. If necessary, additional requirements and instructions will be provided in the application, and must be completed.\n\nNOTE: UF host departments may require additional materials as part of the application process for a given non-degree program. To initiate a request, click here: New J-1 Non-Degree Student Request Form\n\nMailing of the Form DS-2019\n\nThe Form DS-2019 will be mailed to the student once their application is processed. It will be sent via express shipping for students outside the U.S., and standard USPS shipping for students inside the U.S. Students outside the U.S. will automatically receive a tracking number once their Form DS-2019 ships. The average shipping time for international shipments is 5-7 business days. Once the student has the acceptance letter and Form DS-2019, they must pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee and schedule an appointment with the U.S. Consulate or Embassy for the visa application.

Your final transcript will not be issued until you settle all fees required by UFL.
