The University residence halls are single, double or triple occupancy rooms without kitchens and with shared bathrooms. All University residence hall students have access to University residence hall dining rooms. Students can purchase food à la carte at a variety of University Housing dining locations. If you plan to live in the University residence halls, please pay attention to your email account. You will receive an email from the Division of University Housing (from AssignMe@housing.wisc.edu) a few weeks after your acceptance to our exchange program. This email will contain instructions on how to apply for on-campus residence hall housing. Any other housing situation is 'off-campus.' If you plan to live in off-campus housing, it is up to you to find and arrange appropriate accommodations. Most off-campus housing opportunities require a yearlong lease.",
