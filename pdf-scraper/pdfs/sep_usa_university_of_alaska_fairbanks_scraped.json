  "faculties_accepted": ["FASS", "FoS", "CDE"],
  "module_restrictions": "All UAF Schools/Colleges accept exchange students except for the College of Rural and Community Development which has limited course options.",
  "visa_info": "All students are advised to apply for the necessary visa immediately after they receive the official offer letter/email from their host university. Some visa application processes can take up to 2 months to process. Your exchange at the host university depends on the clearance by the immigration of the host country. Once you are admitted to the university, Undergraduate Admissions will send you a Certificate of Eligibility (Form DS-2019). This document, together with your notification of admission, the financial guarantee and your passport, is used to obtain a J-1 visa at a U.S. consulate nearest to you. To apply for a visa in your home country, you must apply early and expect delays. Consult individual embassy Web sites for periodic updates on country-specific visa processing.",
  "accommodations_info": "All on-campus housing (except the Sustainable Village) requires the purchase of a meal plan. Cutler and Wickersham meal plan requirements offer more flexibility with the size of the meal plan, so if students plan on cooking their own meals, they should select one of those two options. Students may request a single room, but it is likely that they will have to share a room with a roommate because of the housing shortage on campus. Rates can be found here: http://www.uaf.edu/reslife/rates/. Please note that undergraduates under the age of 26 are not eligible to apply for the options listed under ‘Affordable Apartment Rates’.",
  "cost_of_living": "There are several mandatory student fees which are not included in a tuition waiver for exchange students. Students should be prepared to pay approximately USD $2,500 in mandatory fees each semester."
