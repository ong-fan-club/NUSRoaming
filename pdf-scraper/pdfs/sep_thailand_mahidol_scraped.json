    "visa_info": "Once your exchange application has been approved by Mahidol, you will receive an acceptance letter, along with a letter for visa application. International students require a Non-Immigrant Education Visa (category ED) to study in Thailand. Applications should be made at the Royal Thai Embassy before departure to Thailand. Students are advised to apply for the necessary visa immediately after they received the official offer letter/email from their host university. This is to ensure that you can obtain your visa in time before the start of your exchange term. Your exchange at the host university depends on the clearance by the immigration of the host country.",
