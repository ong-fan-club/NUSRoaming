This is to ensure that you can obtain your visa in time before the start of your exchange term. Your exchange at the host university depends on the clearance by the immigration of the host country.\nFor more information on visa applications, please refer to https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500.",
