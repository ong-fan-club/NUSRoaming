  "accommodations_info": "NYCU has a number of residence halls for exchange students. Once accepted into a residence hall, students are able to stay for the period of their studies at NYCU. However, due to high demand for housing, on-campus accommodation is not guaranteed. Off-campus housing is also an option that exchange students may choose. However, students who wish to live off-campus are responsible for securing their own housing. Residences located off-campus are owned and operated by private individuals or companies, and NYCU is unable to make any arrangements on behalf of the students. Safety and the availability of public transportation should be taken into consideration when evaluating possible off-campus accommodations. Common price for off-campus accommodation ranges from USD$170 to USD$400 per month.",
