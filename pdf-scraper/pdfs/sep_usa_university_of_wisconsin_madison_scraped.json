  "module_restrictions": "Exchange students are rarely, if ever, allowed to enroll in courses from UW-Madison professional schools (Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing, Law, Education, etc). Some courses (for example, Economics) are open to exchange students, but are very popular and fill quickly during enrollment time. Within any single department, there may be some courses which are not open to exchange students, or fill entirely with UW-Madison degree-seeking students. Flexibility is key to successful enrollment!

  "visa_info": "If you are interested in taking classes at UW-Madison, your visa status needs to allow you to study at this institution. With few exceptions—English as a Second Language (ESL) and formal exchange students—the Adult and Student Services Center is not authorized to issue the I-20 or DS-2019 for a student visa. Students who hold F-1 or J-1 student visas are not eligible to \"transfer\" this status to UW-Madison while holding a student visa issued from another school, except for the summer term.",
  "accommodations_info": "On-campus housing is through the Division of University Housing. The University residence halls (also known as dormitories) are a short walk or short ride on the campus circular bus route (Route 80) to class. The University residence halls are single, double, or triple occupancy rooms without kitchens and with shared bathrooms. All University residence hall students have access to University residence hall dining rooms. Students can purchase food à la carte at a variety of University Housing dining locations. Off-campus housing is owned and operated by private individuals or companies and therefore, our office in unable to make any commitment or advance arrangements for off-campus housing. Most off-campus housing opportunities require a yearlong lease.",
