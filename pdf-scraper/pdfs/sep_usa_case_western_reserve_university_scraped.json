  "visa_info": "All students are advised to apply for the necessary visa immediately after they receive the official offer letter/email from their host university. Some visa application processes can take up to 2 months to process. Your exchange at the host university depends on the clearance by the immigration of the host country. The I-20 form, which will be issued by the Immigration and Human Resource Services (IRHS), is to be presented to the U.S. consulate or U.S. embassy to apply for an F-1 student visa. Make an appointment as soon as possible because lengthy delays may occur as background checks are performed prior to your appointment. Consular standards for visa eligibility may be considerably more rigorous than the standards you must meet to qualify for a DS-2019. The Consular Officer will require you to provide the same (and possibly additional) financial documentation you provided Case Western Reserve University. You will be required to show this documentation again upon arrival in the United States at your port of entry. United States government regulations require you to attend the school which issues the visa certificate you use to enter the U.S.",
