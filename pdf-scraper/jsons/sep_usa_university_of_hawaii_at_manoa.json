      "on-campus_housing": "During the fall semester, there is a limited amount of on-campus housing available to international exchange students. Students coming to UHM for just the fall semester or for the academic year may apply for on-campus housing online, but are encouraged to explore off-campus housing options. Undergraduates are given preference for on-campus housing. During the spring semester, on-campus housing is widely available. International exchange students coming to UHM for the spring semester or calendar year are welcome to apply for on-campus housing online, and have a high likelihood of being placed. Apply for On-Campus Housing – In order to apply for on-campus housing, you need a UH Number (found on your Acceptance letter). Students may apply for on-campus housing online at UHM Student Housing Services. There is a $25 application fee that should be paid with a credit card. Please be sure to use the “Non-Freshman” application form; do NOT use the “Freshman” application form. Please note that the housing contracts at UHM are for the entire academic year (two semesters). If you will only be studying at UHM for the Fall semester, that’s OK. We will inform Student Housing Services and later they will be able to release you from the second half of your contract. ",
