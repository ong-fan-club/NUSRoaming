The certificate is required for you to apply for a study visa. Exchange students must obtain a “College Student” visa for the duration of their study in Japan. Please visit the Japan Embassy website for the required supporting documents for your visa application. All students are advised to apply for the necessary visa immediately after they received the official offer letter/email from their host university. This is to ensure that you can obtain your visa in time before the start of your exchange term. Your exchange at the host university depends on the clearance by the immigration of the host country.",
