          One of the unique features of NUSRoaming is the review section, which allows seniors who have completed their SEP to share their experiences and insights. These reviews play a crucial role in helping you gain valuable firsthand information about universities, courses, accommodations, local customs, and more. By reading reviews from seniors who have already been through the SEP journey, you can make better-informed decisions and have a smoother transition during their exchange program.
