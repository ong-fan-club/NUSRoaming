Students can reach campus by bus (free) or within 15 minutes by walking. The apartments are fully furnished, include free wi-fi, on-site fitness, and in-apartment laundry. Rent for these apartments is billed to students Cornell account and there is no 12 month lease required. Off-Campus Housing: Students may choose to find their own housing off-campus. Incoming exchange students who wish to search for their own off-campus accommodation should refer to the resources listed in the learning content pages of their application. Exchange students should begin their search right away, and they should be aware that it is difficult to find one-semester leases near campus in the fall in comparison to the spring when there are usually quite a few sublets available.

        "accommodations_info": "Due to a shortage of on-campus accommodation at UND, exchange and visiting international students are not guaranteed on-campus housing. Thus, some students will need to secure their own off-campus housing. Students who wish to live on campus will need to fill out a housing application and will be entered in a lottery. Students living off campus are able to sign up for a meal plan. If available, there are 31 undergraduate residence halls that represent 31 distinctive communities, which together with Notre Dame\u2019s two graduate housing facilities, continue the rich tradition of residential life at the University. From the earliest days, residential life has been a defining characteristic of the Notre Dame education. Social events, inter-hall sports, community service projects, spiritual retreats, and time-honored traditions unique to each residence hall define Notre Dame's culture and have created what truly is the Notre Dame family. If you are required to seek off-campus housing on your own, you will receive notification of this as early as possible. Further assistance will be provided by NDI. Please note that filling out the housing application for the on-campus dormitories does not guarantee a spot on campus. On the rare occasion that on-campus housing is not available, you may be asked to find housing off-campus even if you have already filled out the housing application for on-campus dorms. You will still be able to participate in dorm activities and can request to be \u201cadopted\u201d by a dorm to be involved in their events. Students will be provided with a meal plan offered through campus dining. The meal plan is included in the program cost. While the plan allows students to eat food in the two dining halls at Notre Dame, they can use Domer Dollars to buy a meal from other food places on campus. Domer Dollars provide campus ID card-holders the ability to make purchases at many on-campus businesses and select off-campus merchants without the need to carry cash or credit cards. Campus vending and laundry also accept Domer Dollars and unlike a credit card, there are no deposit fees, no mounting debts with Domer Dollars, no interest charged, and no monthly bill \u2013 just a record of the debits made from your already deposited funds.",

The full workload for regular ETH students is 30 ECTS per semester. Study plans and selected courses are subject to approval by the departmental exchange coordinator of the department of enrolment at ETH Zurich. Courses ending with \u2013AAL are not open to exchange students. Modules from the department of Management, Technology and Economics (D-MTEC) are not open to NUS exchange students. Biology (D-BIOL): For block courses, there is an internal registration procedure and places are limited. Note that block courses are very difficult to combine with courses from other study programmes, they are intended only for combination with the Departments\u2019 concept courses. More information can be found on the website of D-BIOL. Computer Science (D-INFK): Especially the Department of Computer Science has recently defined their admission criteria in a more specific but also somewhat more restrictive manner. Their respective conditions for the admission of exchange students can be found on their website. Humanities, Social and Political Sciences: No enrolment is possible in the department of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences (D-GESS), incoming students may only take individual courses (max. 1/3 of all courses/ECTS) as electives. Management, Technology and Economics: Students applying to the department of management, technology, and economics (D-MTEC) must have completed their Bachelor's degree in the field of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, information technology, natural sciences, or any other equivalent field of study. In order to be accepted in the department of Mathematics (D-MATH) at ETH Zurich, a student must be enrolled for a degree in mathematics in their home university. Please note that courses offered by the department of Mechanical and Process Engineering (D-MAVT) in the category Engineering Tools, Laboratory Practice, Focus Project, and Workshop Floor are not allowed for incoming mobility students. Enrollment is not possible in the department of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences (D-GESS) and students can only take the department\u2019s courses as electives (max. 1/3 of courses).

Instructions on how to apply for it will be provided to students when they register in person at our helpdesk. Students need to follow the instructions and apply for their residence permit within 14 days after arrival. Important: The exact duration of the residence permit is calculated from the day of entrance to Switzerland and according to the duration of studies confirmed by ETH Zurich in the official confirmation of acceptance. Students should therefore never enter Switzerland before the start date stated on their official confirmation of acceptance. Otherwise, they risk their residence permit expiring before the last day of their planned mobility stay and not being able to write their final exams or finish their project/thesis work. In such case, they would have to apply for an extension of their residence permit at a charge. This applies to all non-EU/EFTA nationals, with and without a visa requirement, even if the visa authorization or the issued visa theoretically allows an earlier entry to Switzerland!

All student accommodation in the city and the suburbs is located no further than 30 minutes from campus by using public transportation. Housing is not guaranteed, but so far ETH has usually been able to find accommodation for all overseas exchange students who registered with ETH\u2019s Housing Office within the set deadlines. After acceptance, students will receive information on registering for accommodation by email. They should read this information carefully and apply online within the set deadlines. Please note: Students coming for research projects can only apply for housing if they are staying for the regular semester dates. Students older than 28 years cannot be accommodated in our student housing. Housing for students coming in the autumn semester is only available until 31 January and therefore not for the entire duration of the session examinations. Students staying for the full duration of the session examinations and having examinations in February would need to find alternative housing on their own for those 2-3 weeks. We may only be able to offer some partial financial support (subject to availability), yet this may not cover the full additional costs. Should a student initially only apply for one semester of exchange and then later on wish to extend for another semester, we may not be able to provide accommodation, i.e. the student may need to find something on his or her own.",

Bear Creek is run by the university and offers many social activities in addition to housing. Accommodation is in self-catering, ensuite apartments for students who are beyond their first year of university study. You apply as an individual and will be matched with roommates(s). Although the normal contract is for 9 or 12 months, if you will only be here for a semester, Bear Creek will allow a contract for the semester only if space allows. You apply online. **Note that Bear Creek is not an option for exchange students for the 2021-2022 Academic Year.\n- Off-campus housing: we strongly recommend that students who wish to live off-campus arrive to find housing 1 - 2 weeks earlier than the date on the immigration document.\n- Advice on housing from former exchange students: a good source of information about housing in Boulder can come from former or current exchange students.

        "visa_info": "A visa is a document granting permission for entry and/or extended stay in a country. Visas are stamped or fastened into an applicant\u2019s passport. You are responsible for obtaining the necessary visas and for all associated costs. In most cases, the process of obtaining a visa is smooth when the application is made well ahead of time and the destination country\u2019s instructions are followed carefully. Requirements for student visas vary from programme to programme, country to country, consulate to consulate, and term to term. The type of visa you will need depends on your citizenship, type of experience (study only, internship, tourism, and so on), the country or countries you visit, and the duration of each stay. You may seek advice from a CGIS advisor or program sponsor, but obtaining the appropriate visa is your responsibility. Familiarize yourself with the host country visa requirements for citizens of your own home country. CGIS cannot obtain a visa for you nor does CGIS have control over consulates and the regulations they impose. Be aware that you need a passport before applying for a visa, that some countries have certain medical requirements, and that the application process can take up to 4 months. Begin investigating visa requirements immediately after being accepted into a program to provide enough time for the entire process. You might be required to go in person to your host country's consulate or embassy to apply, which might require travel to another city or state. If you are not US citizens but possess a Green Card (Permanent Residence) for the US, follow the visa instructions for the country that issued your official passport. Contact your host country's consulate immediately and follow their instructions. If you do not have a Green Card, inform the UM International Center that you are going abroad to ensure all conditions of your US student visa are met.",
